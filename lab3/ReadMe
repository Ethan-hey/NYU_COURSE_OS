The mmu program is developed in C++, thus we need a C++ compiler to compile it.

Other than source code, it also comes with a simple Makefile. You can either type "make" or 
"make mmu" to generate an executable file called mmu. Or you can always type the command 
"g++ algobase.cpp algoObject.cpp MMU.CPP main.cpp -o mmu"(or any names you want for executable file, case sensitive!!). 

Once we have the executable file, just type ¡°./mmu [-a<algo>] [-o<options>] [-f<num_frames>] inputfile randfile¡±
 or your own shell script to run it. Options can be  passed in any order.  The default options is -al -oS -f32! 

For your information, since several algorithms really differs a little from each other, I put all the algorithms objects in algoObject.
