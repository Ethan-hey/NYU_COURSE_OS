The Scheduler program is developed in C++, thus we need a C++ compiler to compile it.

Other than source code, it also comes with a simple Makefile. You can either type "make" or 
"make Scheduler" to generate an executable file called Scheduler. Or you can always type the command 
"g++ Process.cpp Scheduler.cpp SchedObject.cpp Simulator.cpp main.cpp -o Scheduler"(or any names you want for executable file). 

Once we have the executable file, just type ¡°./Scheduler [-v] [-s<schedspec>] inputfile randfile¡± to run it. 
Options can be  passed in any order.
